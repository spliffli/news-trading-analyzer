* Added command line options: -s -f -n -d -q -u -V -h.  See the manpage.
* Specific jobs can now be selected on the command line.
* Added SIGUSR1 handling, to cleanly stop execution.
* Jobs will now be started with their current directory set to the home
  of the user running Anacron (usually root).
