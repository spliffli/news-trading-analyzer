It's been a while since I looked at this project because of personal circumstances but I want to give a more concise outline of my system that's quicker to read than the [in-depth explanation](system-explained-en.md) that I wrote last year ([Deutsche Version](system-explained-de.md)).

The system I've developed is quite unique among trading strategies. Very few people in the world are doing this type of trading, and nobody else has publicly released an analysis tool like mine ([Available on Github](https://github.com/spliffli/news-trading-analyzer)).

99.99% of trading advice online is about technical analysis or TA, which pretty much always involves something working in the short term but not in the long term because market behaviours change over time and the strategy breaks. The current price is always an after-effect, not a cause. The same is true for technical indicators like RSI, MACD, moving averages, etc. TA is a fallacy and that's why most people lose, since most people use only TA. Smart money always has an edge and they live basic TA to the masses to provide their liquidity in the market.
