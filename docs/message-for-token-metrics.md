# Hi there!

I'm writing this motivation letter to apply for the position of Crypto Quantitative Analyst.

I'm working on a forex low-latency algorithmic news trading system and [this](https://newstradingsystem.com) is the website for that system.

I am moving to Zürich next week because I have been offered a job at UrbanPharm working with CBD plants and I'm passionate about that and coding, plus I've never worked for a tech company so I was wondering if I could maybe start part-time so it costs you less but would still give me a chance to do programming as a career since so far I'm just self-taught working on my own projects but I'd like to get involved with a team and work on building things.

Ich kann Deutsch aber Englisch ist meine Muttersprache.

I know that I can of contribute a lot to your company. I have finally found a trading system which makes sense and is backed by data, and I believe it's a path to financial freedom as a passive side-income.

I am passionate about coding and want to do it professionally. I also have some experience with C#, Angular, Docker & how to think like a programmer.

Thanks for taking the time to read my motivation letter and I hope to hear back whatever your decision is. I believe I can make 40-50%/month with my system but it costs €1000/month to get the low-latency news data feed from haawks.com so I need a minimum of 3-4k in my balance for it to break even and profit on top of that and so far my account size has been too small.

The new job will pay 4700 CHF/month which is the highest I've ever earned but I'm going to start later this month and I have been out of work for the past 7 months because of personal health problems.

Now I'm ready to continue this project I started because I know the probabilities of winning are very high with news trading because the probabilities/correlations are measured. [Here](https://github.com/spliffli/news-trading-analyzer) is the github for my project written in python.

It is a forex project, which is not directly what you're working on, but I also worked on another python project in 2022 related to crypto trading (Github [here](https://github.com/N2-Jonathon/n2_pairs_trader)) which I wrote for a company in Miami called N2 Capital. I was asked to make a single strategy but ended up making a framework for pairs trading in crypto i.e. using a virtual or synthetic asset by combining two pairs and making an artificial pair.

I do believe the forex idea has more potential, but I'm still interested in crypto trading. 

I know some [FIX API](https://fxcm-api.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fixdocs/fixapi.html) which is used for forex and also crypto exchanges, although my experience with it has only been with forex. Still, there is a lot of overlap and trading is trading, regardless of the asset class.

You can trade the price of some cryptos like BTC & ETH through forex brokers in the form of CFDs. This allows higher leverage than by using a crypto exchange.

I've been working on my own so far, but I've had enough of just working on my own and I'd love to work with other people.

The only type of trading I know is succescul with crypto is arbitrage & there's a great tool for that available [here](https://bjftradinggroup.com/product/sharptrader-forex-crypto-arbitrage/) from BJF Trading.

If I were to trade for you I'd like to use this arbitrage strategy for crypto and possibly if you're interested in exploring forex, I think I have an even better system. Either you can pay me a salary or we can work with a profit-sharing model or a combination of both.

Kind regards,

Jonathon Quick
