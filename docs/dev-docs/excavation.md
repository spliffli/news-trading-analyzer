# Excavation

!!! info
    In this document I'll be taking notes and documenting the process of getting back into this project. 
    As it has been 4 months since I last looked at it, it's just a faded memory and I while I must re-discover, define and improve upon the workflow that I had before.

## **Todo**

- [ ] Create markdown files for each `.py` file
- [ ] For each python file:
    - Go through each function and make sure each function has docstrings
    - Turn docstrings into documentation for the corresponding markdown file under its header.
    - Add additional notes about each function and try to identify where it.
