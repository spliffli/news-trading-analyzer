    <h3>Note:</h3>
    <p>The data below was calculated using historic news & tick data of {{ no_of_releases }} releases from {{ start_date }} to {{ end_date }}.</p>
    <p>It combines the data from releases with positive deviations and releases with negative deviations. For the releases with negative deviations, the pip movements were multiplied by -1 to conform with the data from positive deviations. Therefore, a positive number signifies movement in the expected direction and a negative number signifies movement in the opposite direction. Later I will change this template to show the seperate data for positive and negative deviations</p>
